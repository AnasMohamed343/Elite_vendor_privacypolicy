Privacy Policy

We take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in the Elite Membership Vendor app, which is used by authorized administrators to validate user discount cards via QR scans.

Information We Collect

Admin Account Information
Pre-registered admins must log in using credentials provided by the system.

Email and password are stored securely via database.

Camera access (QR scans).

Profile Pictures (if uploaded by admins).

QR Scan Data (Temporary Processing)
When scanning a user’s Elite Membership card QR code, the app validates:

Cardholder’s name, photo, and validity status.

Expiration dates and membership details.

This data is not stored in the app or on the device—it is processed in real-time via API calls and discarded after validation.

Device Information (Automatically Collected)
IP address and timestamp for API request logging (anonymous, for security and debugging).

Device type and OS version (for technical support).

How We Use Your Information

Third-Party Services
